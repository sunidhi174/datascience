Reddit is a beautiful platform where you can connect with people with similar interests by subsribing to, what is called a subreddit, the community. On such community is [r/dataisbeautiful](https://old.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) (r/ references a subreddit) where people from data science community post interesting (and sometimes funny) visualiztion using tools like D3.js, matplotlib, Bokeh, Tableau and many more. 

This beautiful subreddit also hosts a monthly visualization competition by providing a small dataset. This month the admins of subreddit have posted a [data](http://www.grg.org/Adams/C.HTM) that contains a list of oldest people and various attributes. I've cleaned the dataset as per my requirements and can be accessed [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/datasets/geriatric.csv).

I've tried to visualize the relationship between gender, ethnicity and birthplace and deathplace using [Raw Graphs](https://rawgraphs.io) open source project.

So from the visualization, so far the oldest people in the world have been white women from United States. Cheers
